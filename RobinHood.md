That edge has been neutralized as most of the brokerage industry joined in eliminating commissions. Despite the increased competition on cost, Robinhood has developed a strong brand and niche market with young, tech savvy investors thanks to a clean design and user experience that focuses on the basics. The broker recently added cash management services and a recurring investment feature in an effort to attract new customers and deepen the financial relationship with existing customers.
